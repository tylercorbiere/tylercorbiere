- 👋 Hi, I’m Tyler Corbiere, a 23-year-old living in Canada.
- 👀 I’m interested in developing a strong set of skills in the tech space so I can one day land a position in CyberSecurity.
- 🌱 I’m currently taking Harvard's CS50's Introduction to Cybersecurity online course.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner-intermediate projects to start getting real-world experience.
- 📫 You can reach me on Discord with a short message via this username tjc1236.
- 💪 My current strengths are mostly in basic hardware as I have built PCs and mining rigs and some strength in 3d Printing.
